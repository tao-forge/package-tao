A resource many contain references to assets that are all of the same type or different types i.e. file formats. The Variant class points to the alternative resource. Metadata is used to describe the nature of a collection of alternative assets and their intended use. Examples include, but are not limited to, use as lingual variants, visual or auditory variants, remediation variants or platform delivery variants. The scope of referenced assts is specific to a Variant object. Their use is in the context of the parent object containing a variant instance, typically a bound instance of a Resource object from the IMS CP namespace.</p>
