/**
 * Interface Timer
 *
 * Describes the API needed yo build and manage a timer.
 * A Timer is represented by a TimeLine on which it will apply actions and constraints.
 * The actions are:
 * - add time ranges by setting start and end TimePoints (SERVER)
 * - adjust time ranges by settings intermediate start and end TimePoint (CLIENT)
 * - compute duration for particular targets (SERVER or CLIENT)
 *
 * The constraints are:
 * - coherence of time ranges
 * - time limits and timeouts
 *
 * A timer is also responsible of its storage.
