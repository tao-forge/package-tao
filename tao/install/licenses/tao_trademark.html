    <!--<h2 class="license2">Introduction</h2>-->
    <p class="justify">“TAO Trademarks” hereinafter refers to both the TAO
        trademarks (TAO®, TAO ™) and Generis4 trademarks (Generis® and Generis ™).</p>
    <p class="justify">This document outlines the policy regarding the use of the
        TAO trademarks as defined by their respective right holders, namely the
        Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor and the University of Luxembourg.
        Any use that does not comply with this trademark policy or does not have
        prior written authorization from their right holders is prohibited.</p>
    <p class="justify">This policy attempts to balance two competing interests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="justify">We need to ensure that the TAO
                trademarks remain reliable indicators of quality, security, and
                confidence for the TAO platform.</p>
        <li><p class="justify">We also need to permit community
                members and software distributors to diffuse and promote the TAO
                platform and all related products.</p>
        <li><p class="justify">We also need to allow anyone to
                accurately describe his or her affiliation with the TAO project.</p>
    </ul>
    <p class="justify">This Trademark Policy
        is strongly inspired by the Mozilla Trademark Policy. Unless
        otherwise indicated, the text of this TAO Trademark Policy is
        available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike license
        v2.0 or any later version

    <p class="justify">The rights in the
        trademarks, logos, service marks of the Centre de Recherche Public
        Henri Tudor and of the University of Luxembourg, are not licensed
        under the Creative Commons license, and to the extent they are works
        of authorship (like logos and graphic design), they are not included
        in the work that is licensed under those terms.</p>
    <p><font style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold"><b>Use of
            TAO trademark in printed materials</b></font></p>
    <p class="justify">Although many uses of
        the TAO trademarks are governed by more specific rules, which appear
        below, the following basic guidelines apply to almost any use of the
        TAO trademarks in printed materials, including marketing, articles
        and other publicity-related materials, such as websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="justify">Proper Form - TAO trademarks
                should be used in their exact form -- neither abbreviated nor
                combined with any other word or words;</p>
        <li><p class="justify">Notice - The following notice
                should appear somewhere nearby (at least on the same page or on the
                credits page) the first use of a TAO trademark:</p>
    </ul>
    <p class="justify" id="border">
        TAO® is a joint initiative of the CRP Henri Tudor and the University
        of Luxembourg.</p>
    <p class="justify">Comply with visual
        identity - any use of the TAO Trademarks must comply with their
        visual identity as set forth hereby:</p>

    <br/>
    <p class="justify"><font style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Use of TAO Trademarks for Software
            Distributions</font></p>
    <p class="justify"><i><b>Unaltered
                Binaries</b></i></p>
    <p class="justify">You may distribute
        unchanged official binaries (i.e., the installer file available for
        download for each platform) downloaded from the official TAO website
        (www.tao.lu) to anyone in any way, subject to governing law, without
        receiving any further permission from us.</p>
    <p class="justify">However, you must not
        remove or change any part of the official binary, including the TAO
        Trademarks. On your website or in other materials, you may truthfully
        state that the software you are providing is an unmodified version of
        the TAO platform, keeping in mind the overall guidelines for the use
        of TAO Trademarks in printed materials, detailed above. We suggest
        that, if you choose to provide visitors to your website the
        opportunity to download TAO product, you do so by means of a link to
        our site, to help ensure reliable downloads. (See the section on
        Linking, below.)</p>
    <p class="justify">If you choose to
        distribute the TAO platform binaries yourself, you should make the
        latest stable version available (of course, you probably want to do
        so as well). So that users get the latest code and security releases,
        we encourage you to always distribute the most current official
        release.</p>
    <p class="justify">If you are using the
        TAO trademark(s) for the unaltered binaries you are distributing, you
        may not charge for that product. By not charging, we mean the TAO
        product must be without cost and its distribution (whether by
        download or other media) may not be subject to a fee, or tied to
        subscribing to or purchasing a service, or the collection of personal
        information. If you want to sell the product, you may do so, but you
        must call that product by another name—one unrelated to TAO or any
        of the TAO Trademarks (see the sections on &quot;Modifications&quot;
        and &quot;Related Software&quot; below). Remember that we do not want
        the public to be confused.</p>
    <p class="justify"><i><b>Modifications</b></i></p>
    <p class="justify">As open-source
        software, TAO may be freely modified to integrate new functionalities
        or to implement any functional and non-functional requirement you may
        have. While the GPL license allows to redistribute your modified
        version under conditions stated in the GPL license, you may not
        redistribute it under any of the TAO trademark, or using a name or
        logo that contains part or complete TAO trademark names, or that may
        confuse the user into believing he is using an official TAO product. 
    </p>
    <p class="justify">Any modified version of
        TAO products, including adding to, modifying in any way, or deleting
        content from the files included with an installer, file location
        changes, added code, modification of any source files including
        additions and deletions, etc..., cannot be identified, advertised, or
        redistributed using the TAO trademarks without our written
        permission. 
    </p>
    <p class="justify">If you are confident
        that your work might be of high value and useful for the TAO
        community and believe it worth being distributed under the TAO brand,
        you may consider submitting your code and related documentation to
        the TAO team through the forge for potential further integration into
        the public distribution on the official web site, either with the
        core distribution, or as a contributed extension. We also strongly
        encourage to redistribute translated and localized versions through
        the official web site, since redistribution from another source of a
        new localized version of TAO is not authorized under the TAO
        trademark without our prior permission.</p>
    <p class="justify"><i><b>Related Software</b></i></p>
    <p class="justify">TAO platform is
        designed to be extended, and we recognize that community members
        writing extensions need some way to identify the TAO product to which
        their extensions pertain. Our main concern about extensions is that
        consumers not be confused as to whether they are official (meaning
        approved by the TAO project) or not. To address that concern, we
        request that extension names not include, in whole or in part, the
        word &quot;TAO&quot;, or &quot;Generis4&quot; in a way that suggests
        a connection between TAO and the extension.</p>
    <p class="justify"><font style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Linking</font></p>
    <p class="justify">We invite you to link
        to TAO's official website (www.tao.lu) for the purpose of allowing
        your visitors to download the TAO platform, by using links and/or the
        banners we might provide, subject to the restrictions below.</p>
    <p class="justify"><font style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Services
            Related to the TAO platform</font></p>
    <p class="justify">If you offer services
        related to the TAO platform, you may use TAO's word trademarks in
        describing and advertising your services relating to a TAO product,
        so long as you don't violate these overall guidelines for the use of
        TAO trademarks or do anything that might mislead customers into
        thinking that either your website, service, or product is an official
        TAO website, service, or product, or that TAO has any direct
        relationship with your organization.</p>
    <p class="justify">For example, you may
        write on your website &quot;Computer based assessment customization
        services for TAO available here.&quot; Though you may not write &quot;TAO
        computer based assessment customization services sold here,&quot; or
        &quot;custom TAO computer based assessment available here,&quot;
        since the first suggests that TAO is related to your business, and
        the second is confusing as to whom -- you or TAO -- performed the
        customization. In addition, your website may not copy the look and
        feel of the TAO website. Again, we do not want the visitor to your
        website to be confused with whom she/he is dealing.</p>
    <p class="justify">If you are offering
        services for the TAO platform (for example, support), you may not tie
        the download of the TAO product with the purchase of your service.
        The download of the TAO product using the TAO trademark may not be
        connected in any way to the purchase of your service. The purchase,
        download, or acquisition of your services must be a completely
        separate transaction from the download of the TAO product. You must
        provide a prominent statement that (i) the TAO platform is available
        for free and link directly to our site; (ii) the purchase, download,
        or acquisition of your service is separate from the download of the
        TAO product; and (iii) your service is not affiliated with TAO.</p>
